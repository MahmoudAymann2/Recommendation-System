This repository contains a Python implementation of a comprehensive course recommendation system. The project is designed to preprocess and analyze a dataset of online courses and generate course recommendations based on multiple algorithms. The system incorporates collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, a hybrid approach, and knowledge-based recommendations.

Key Features
    Data Preprocessing:
        Handles missing values in the dataset by filling ratings with the mean and difficulties with the mode.
        Converts enrollment numbers from formats like '1k' and '1M' into numeric values.
        Normalizes the ratings and enrollment numbers for consistent scaling.  
    Visualization:
        Provides insights into the distribution of ratings, correlations, and the difficulty levels of courses.
        Displays bar plots of the top 10 most-enrolled courses.
    Recommendation Approaches:
        Collaborative Filtering:
            Uses a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model to recommend courses based on user interactions.
        Content-Based Filtering:
            Computes the similarity of course titles using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.
        Hybrid Approach:
            Combines collaborative and content-based filtering to generate recommendations.
        Knowledge-Based Recommendations:
            Suggests courses based on user-defined preferences, such as difficulty and minimum rating.     
    Evaluation:
        Uses metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance of each recommendation algorithm.
        Displays a comparative analysis of the algorithms through bar plots and precision-recall curves.
    Comprehensive Recommendation Outputs:
        Provides recommendations for individual users and displays the results in a tabular format.
        Generates similarity scores for recommended courses and visualizes them using bar plots.
        
How to Use
    Dataset:
        The code requires a dataset containing the following columns: Unnamed: 0, course_title, course_organization, course_Certificate_type, course_rating, course_difficulty, and course_students_enrolled.   
    Dependencies:
        The code utilizes libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and warnings. Ensure these dependencies are installed in your Python environment.
    Execution:
        Run the script in a Python environment. It will preprocess the data, generate visualizations, and display recommendations for each algorithm.

File Structure
        data_preprocessing.py: Handles data cleaning, normalization, and missing value imputation.
        recommendation_system.py: Implements the recommendation algorithms and evaluation.
        visualization.py: Contains functions for generating visual insights into the dataset.
        README.md: This file, which describes the project and its functionality.


Example Outputs
    A heatmap displaying the correlation between normalized ratings and enrollment numbers.
    Bar plots highlighting the most-enrolled courses and difficulty level distributions.
    Precision-recall curves for collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, hybrid, and knowledge-based approaches.


Applications
    This codebase can be used to develop:
    Course recommendation engines for e-learning platforms.
    Personalized learning systems for students based on their preferences.
    Data analysis projects to understand trends in online education.
